# terraform-aws-ssm-parameter-store [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ssm-parameter-store.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ssm-parameter-store) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ssm-parameter-store.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ssm-parameter-store/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module for providing read and write access to the AWS SSM Parameter Store.


---

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).









## Introduction

* [AWS Details on what values can be used](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-paramstore-su-create.html)
* [AWS API for PutParameter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/APIReference/API_PutParameter.html)
* [Terraform aws_ssm_parameter resource page](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/ssm_parameter.html)
* [Terraform aws_ssm_parameter data page](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/d/ssm_parameter.html)





## Examples

This example creates a new `String` parameter called `/cp/prod/app/database/master_password` with the value of `password1`.

```hcl
module "store_write" {
  source          = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ssm-parameter-store?ref=master"
  parameter_write = [{
  name            = "/cp/prod/app/database/master_password"
  value           = "password1"
  type            = "String"
  overwrite       = "true"
  description     = "Production database master password"
  }]

  tags = {
    ManagedBy = "Terraform"
  }
}
```

### Simple Read Parameter Example

This example reads a value from the parameter store with the name `/cp/prod/app/database/master_password`

```hcl
module "store_read" {
  source         = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ssm-parameter-store?ref=master"
  parameter_read = ["/cp/prod/app/database/master_password"]
}
```

### Additional Examples

The [`example`](./example) directory contains complete working examples with variations of how to use the module.
